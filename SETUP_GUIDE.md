# Claude Code Analysis Setup Guide - Elation Health

Set up Claude Code for business analysis with Snowflake, dbt, and Looker.

**Audience:** Non-technical users with no command line experience. Claude Code (an AI assistant) will guide you through most steps.

---

## Choose Your Setup Path

| Path | Use if... |
|------|-----------|
| **Claude Enterprise** | You have access to Claude Code Enterprise via Okta |
| **AWS Bedrock** | You're using Elation's internal AWS infrastructure for AI |

Not sure which? Ask in #data-platform.

---

## How This Guide Works

| Phase | What | Timeline |
|-------|------|----------|
| **Phase 0** | Submit IT support tickets | Do first - takes 1-2 business days |
| **Phase 1** | Manual setup steps | While waiting for IT |
| **Phase 2** | Let Claude Code complete configuration | After IT responds |

**Total active time:** ~30 minutes (spread across 1-2 days while waiting for IT)

---

## Phase 0: IT Support Tickets (Submit First!)

Before starting technical setup, you need access credentials from IT. Submit these tickets **now** - they may take 1-2 business days.

---

### Tickets Required for Both Paths

---

#### Ticket A: Snowflake Access (Required)

**General Questions:** Data Platform ([#team_data_platform](https://elation.slack.com/archives/C03MUBG02SC))

##### Step 1: Request access in [#ask-it](https://elation.slack.com/archives/CABPVMDHP)

Copy and send this message:

```
Hi IT team,

I'm setting up Claude Code for business analysis at Elation Health.
I need Snowflake access to run read-only queries for internal reporting, ad-hoc analysis, and dashboard investigation.

Please grant me: SNOWFLAKE - TEAM_PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT

**Important:** You need ALL credentials before starting Phase 2.

---

## Phase 1: Manual Setup (While Waiting for IT)

Steps 1–3 and 5–6 are the same for both paths. Step 4 differs slightly.

### Step 1: Open Terminal

1. Press `Cmd + Space` to open Spotlight
2. Type `Terminal`
3. Press Enter

A window with a command prompt will appear. This is where you'll type commands.

**Tip:** Copy commands from this guide and paste into Terminal with `Cmd + V`.

---

### Step 2: Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a tool that helps install other software. Copy and paste this command:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Press Enter and follow any prompts. This may take a few minutes.

**Important:** After installation, Homebrew may show you commands to run. Copy and paste those commands too.

Verify it worked:
```bash
brew --version
```

You should see a version number like `Homebrew 4.x.x`.

---

### Step 3: Install Python and Node.js

Run this command:

```bash
brew install python@3.12 node@20
```

Verify:
```bash
python3 --version
node --version
```

---

### Step 4: Install Claude Code

**Both paths:**
```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

**AWS Bedrock path only — also install AWS CLI:**
```bash
brew install awscli
```

Verify:
```bash
claude --version
# AWS Bedrock path only:
aws --version
```

---

### Step 5: Clone the Setup Files

Create a folder for your work:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/Documents/GitHub
cd ~/Documents/GitHub
```

Download the setup files:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:elationemr/claude-analysis-setup.git
git clone git@github.com:elationemr/snowflake_idw.git
git clone git@github.com:elationemr/internal_dw.git
```

---

### Step 6: Generate Snowflake Keys

Run these commands to create your authentication keys:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
openssl genrsa 2048 | openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -out ~/.ssh/snowflake_private_key.p8 -nocrypt
openssl rsa -in ~/.ssh/snowflake_private_key.p8 -pubout -out ~/.ssh/snowflake_public_key.pub
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/snowflake_private_key.p8
```

**Important:** Now send your public key to [#team_data_platform](https://elation.slack.com/archives/C03MUBG02SC):

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/snowflake_public_key.pub
```

Copy the output and send it with this message:
> Hi Data Platform team - I'm setting up Snowflake key-pair authentication for Claude Code and need help from a Snowflake administrator.
>
> Could a Snowflake admin please set my RSA public key on my Snowflake user account?
>
> Reference: https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth
>
> Command to run:
> `ALTER USER <username> SET RSA_PUBLIC_KEY='<public_key_contents>';`
>
> My public key:
> [paste key here]

---

## Phase 2: Claude-Assisted Setup (After ALL Tickets Complete)

### Step 1: Start Claude Code

**Claude Enterprise path:**

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/claude-analysis-setup
claude
```

Claude Code will open a browser window — log in with your Okta credentials.

**AWS Bedrock path:**

First, log into AWS:

```bash
aws sso login --profile AIPlayground
```

This opens a browser window - log in with your Okta credentials.

Then launch Claude Code with your inference profile ARNs from #team_infra:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/claude-analysis-setup
AWS_PROFILE=AIPlayground AWS_REGION=us-west-2 CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1 \
  ANTHROPIC_MODEL="[YOUR_DEFAULT_INFERENCE_PROFILE_ARN]" \
  ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL="[YOUR_HAIKU_INFERENCE_PROFILE_ARN]" \
  claude
```

**Example with real ARNs:**
```bash
cd ~/Documents/GitHub/claude-analysis-setup
AWS_PROFILE=AIPlayground AWS_REGION=us-west-2 CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=1 \
  ANTHROPIC_MODEL="arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2:303970654249:application-inference-profile/abc123xyz" \
  ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL="arn:aws:bedrock:us-west-2:303970654249:application-inference-profile/def456uvw" \
  claude
```

---

### Step 2: Copy This Prompt Into Claude Code

Find your path below, fill in your credentials, then paste the entire prompt.

---

**Claude Enterprise path prompt:**

```
I'm a non-technical user setting up Claude Code for data analysis. I've completed the manual setup:
- Installed Homebrew, Python 3.12, Node.js 20
- Installed Claude Code
- Cloned repos: claude-analysis-setup, snowflake_idw, internal_dw
- Generated Snowflake keys (sent public key to #team_data_platform)
- Logged into Claude Code via Okta

Setup path: Claude Enterprise

I have received these credentials from IT:
- Snowflake Username: [FILL IN - e.g., JANEDOE]
- Looker Client ID: [FILL IN]
- Looker Client Secret: [FILL IN]

Please complete my setup. For each step:
1. Explain what you're doing in simple terms
2. Run the commands for me
3. Tell me if I need to do anything
4. Confirm it worked before moving on

## Setup Steps to Complete:

### 1. Create output folder
Create ~/Documents/GitHub/ad_hoc_analysis

### 2. Set up dbt (data tool)
- Create Python environment in snowflake_idw folder
- Install dbt-snowflake and pandas packages
- Verify dbt works

### 3. Install 1Password CLI
- Install via: brew install --cask 1password-cli
- Help me sign in: op signin
- Tell me how to enable CLI in 1Password app:
  1. Open 1Password app
  2. Go to Settings (top left menu under File)
  3. Click "Developer" in sidebar
  4. Enable "Integrate with 1Password CLI"
  5. Click "Security" in the left sidebar
  6. Enable "Touch ID" for CLI authentication

### 4. Add to 1Password Employee vault and store credentials
Guide me to create items in 1Password following this EXACT structure:

#### Create "Looker API" item (type: API Credential)
Standard fields used:
- vault: Employee
- username: (leave empty or note)
- credential: (leave empty or note)
Custom fields to add:
- client-secret: [MY_LOOKER_CLIENT_SECRET]

Note: Snowflake uses key-pair authentication (private key file), not password — no Snowflake item needed in 1Password.

### 5. Configure shell environment
Create/update my ~/.zshrc using the Claude Enterprise template in SETUP_GUIDE.md, replacing all placeholder values with my actual credentials.

### 6. Copy Claude config files
- Create ~/.claude/commands and ~/.claude/skills folders
- Copy settings.json from claude-analysis-setup to ~/.claude/
- Copy analysis.md from claude-analysis-setup/commands/ to ~/.claude/commands/
- Copy snowflake-query.md from claude-analysis-setup/skills/ to ~/.claude/skills/
- Update all files: replace YOUR_USERNAME with my macOS username (find with: whoami)

### 7. Create dbt profile
Create ~/.dbt/profiles.yml with my credentials.

### 8. Test everything
- Test Snowflake connection: dbt debug
- Test 1Password: load_api_keys
- Run a simple /analysis command

Let's start with step 1!
```

| **Looker API** | API Credential | client-secret (custom) | `op://Employee/Looker API/client-secret` |

**Note:** Snowflake uses key-pair authentication (private key file at `~/.ssh/snowflake_private_key.p8`), not a password. Claude Enterprise authentication is handled via Okta — no additional 1Password item needed.

## What to Expect During Phase 2

| Step | Claude Does | You Do |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1-2 | Runs commands | Watch and wait |
| 3 | Installs 1Password CLI | Enter your 1Password password; enable CLI in app |
| 4 | Guides 1Password setup | Add item to Employee vault in 1Password app |
| 5 | Updates .zshrc | Click "Accept" and provide your credential values |
| 6 | Copies config files | Click "Accept" for each file |
| 7 | Creates dbt profile | Click "Accept" |
| 8 | Tests AWS login *(AWS path only)* | Log in via browser when it opens |
| 9 | Tests everything | Watch for success messages |

---

## After Setup: Daily Usage

```bash
# Open Terminal (Cmd+Space → "Terminal")

# Option 1: Use the shortcut
clc

# Option 2: Manual launch
load_api_keys
aws sso login --profile AIPlayground   # AWS Bedrock path only
cd ~/Documents/GitHub
claude

# Run analysis
/analysis "How many active accounts do we have?"
```

The `clc` shortcut handles authentication and launches Claude Code with all the right settings.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "aws: command not found" | Run: `brew install awscli` *(AWS path only)* |
| "Token has expired" or "Could not load credentials from any providers" | Run: `aws sso login --profile AIPlayground` *(AWS path only)*, then relaunch with `clc` |
| "Snowflake authentication failed" | Check that #team_data_platform registered your public key |
| "`dbt debug` cannot connect to Snowflake" | Verify `account` in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` matches your Snowflake account identifier (use account identifier only, not full URL) |
| "SQL access control error / wrong role" | Ask #team_data_platform to confirm your default Snowflake role, or add `role:` in `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` only if needed |
| "Looker credentials not found" | Run: `op signin`, then `load_api_keys` |
| "op: command not found" | Run: `brew install --cask 1password-cli` |
| 1Password prompts not working | Enable CLI integration in 1Password app Settings > Developer |
